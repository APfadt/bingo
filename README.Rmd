# bingo

Generate Bingo cards.

Currently has built-in squares for SuperBowl 50 :football: and open data / spreadsheet craziness :chart_with_downwards_trend:. Or you can provide your own text for the squares.

Make printable Bingo cards **without installing anything** via these Shiny apps (included in package, but also available on Dean's server):

  * [PDF cards](http://daattali.com/shiny/bingo-pdf/)
  * [HTML cards](http://daattali.com/shiny/bingo-html/)
  
Feel free to help us make these cards less ugly or to explore new bingo topics! PRs welcome :grin:.

## Installation

Install from github with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jennybc/bingo")
```

## SuperBowl Example

```{r fig.show = "hide"}
library(bingo)

## see some of the SuperBowl 50 squares
tail(superbowl_50_2016())

## make 8 bingo cards (SuperBowl 50 is current default)
bc <- bingo(8)

## print them to PDF
plot(bc)
```

Here's what one looks like:

## Open Data Example

These squares are taken from an excellent tweet from Chris McDowall ([\@fogonwater](https://twitter.com/fogonwater)):

> For two weeks I noted issues encountered as I used NZ govt data. Today I collected enough to make a bingo card. *[\@fogonwater, January 3, 2016](https://twitter.com/fogonwater/status/683785398112260097)*

```{r}
## see some of the Open Data squares
tail(open_data())

## make a single Open Data bingo card
bc <- bingo(bs = open_data())

## print it
plot(bc)
```

Here's what one looks like:

![](img/bingo-01-open-data.png)

```{r clean-up, include = FALSE}
crap <- list.files(pattern = "bingo-[0-9]+.pdf")
file.remove(crap)
```

## Run Shiny apps locally

To run the apps we're running remotely ([PDF version](http://daattali.com/shiny/bingo-pdf/), [HTML version](http://daattali.com/shiny/bingo-html/)) on your own machine, do this:

```{r eval = FALSE}
## pdf is the default
launch()

## or go with html
launch("html")
```
