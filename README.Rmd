Generate Bingo cards.

Currently has built-in squares for SuperBowl 50 :football: and open data / spreadsheet craziness :chart_with_downwards_trend:.

## Installation

Install from github with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jennybc/bingo")
```

## SuperBowl Example

```{r fig.show = "hide"}
library(bingo)

## see some of the SuperBowl 50 squares
tail(superbowl_50_2016())

## make 8 bingo cards (SuperBowl 50 is current default)
bc <- bingo(8)

## print them to PDF
plot(bc)
```
