# bingo

Generate Bingo cards.

Currently has built-in squares for SuperBowl 50 :football: and open data / spreadsheet craziness :chart_with_downwards_trend:.

## Installation

Install from github with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jennybc/bingo")
```

## SuperBowl Example

```{r fig.show = "hide"}
library(bingo)

## see some of the SuperBowl 50 squares
tail(superbowl_50_2016())

## make 8 bingo cards (SuperBowl 50 is current default)
bc <- bingo(8)

## print them to PDF
plot(bc)
```

Here's what one looks like:

## Open Data Example

These squares are taken from an excellent tweet from Chris McDowall ([\@fogonwater](https://twitter.com/fogonwater)):

> For two weeks I noted issues encountered as I used NZ govt data. Today I collected enough to make a bingo card. *[\@fogonwater, January 3, 2016](https://twitter.com/fogonwater/status/683785398112260097)*

```{r}
## see some of the Open Data squares
tail(open_data())

## make a single Open Data bingo card
bc <- bingo(bs = open_data())

## print it
plot(bc)
```

Here's what one looks like:

```{r clean-up, include = FALSE}
crap <- list.files(pattern = "bingo-[0-9]+.pdf")
file.remove(crap)
```
